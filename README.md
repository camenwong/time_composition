## TIME:

Looping time; 

Circular time; 

Maintenance (Ukeles Feminism performance manifesto) Perpetuating temporality, repeat daily life; 

Accumulation of time (a piece of awareness of the audience);

Buddhism spinning wheels;

Meditation - repeatedly work, scan body from top to bottom and back, and again and again.

# Score:

Writing as a noise of Memories(plato), Graphical score (Xenakis)

# Sound:

Natural Harmony (i imagine, if the paper gets black (the all history, contribution of awareness of the audience) it will approach this sound)

Noise of Memories (inaccuracy)

# Vilem Flusser:

Open source interface, creativity, feedback in society

improvisation - incorporation

“the improvisation with continually reprogrammed memories will replace the score”

“I suspect that the emphasis on improvisation that we observe in Flussser and in the current practice of electroacoustic and digital music is an attempt to restore the so-called “authenticity of human experience” in the creative process. This effort of reconstructing subjectivity can be also observed in the current scholarship, for instance with the persistence of notions such as presence, materiality, and embodiment, together with the emphasis on the “experience of presence”.

# Heidegger (TECHNICS AND TIME)

The world is already here, before Dasein.

The historical dependence of man on the world in which he lives, there was a time before me, technology is not only the carrier of time, but more importantly, it is the original factor that constitutes time.

Any temporal form contains an "already-being formed independently of any perception".

The theme of **forgetting** dominates Heidegger's thinking of being. **Being is historial**, and the history of being is nothing but its inscription in technicity. If truth is itself thought in terms of this originary forgetting, it is insofar as the determination of the meaning of *alêtheia* still echoes the Platonic structure of reminiscence such as it is determined in opposition to hypomnesic memory, while this memory constitutes the destiny of being as the forgetting of being.

The possibility of refusing the horizon of authentic possibility takes root in "concern *(**Besorgen**),*a relation to the future which conceals in the future the opening of all authentic possibility. 

The technicalization of science consists in ignoring archetypes.

To give meaning to this technical act, and to give its correct result the meaning of truth...the original thought was put aside.

Technicization is what produces **loss of memory**, as was already the case in Plato's *Phœdrus.*
