## TIME:

Looping time; 

Circular time; 

>But while western thinking considers change within a unique process stretching ad infinitum, eastern thinking conceives change within a process that hold together repetition and transformation.

>A clock is not a timeline but a circle for the simple reason that time does not begin or stop, it continues without beginning or end. In the same fashion, days and years are also circular

>However a distinguish must be previously elicited: even though for the ancient Greeks nature repeated itself, such a repetition was a fate that men could not avoid, the recurrence of time is therefore related to a pre-arranged design. Nietzsche moves away from this passive understanding of life, in a sense that he offers to humanity a moment of choice where following the death of god, and so the trans-valuation of values, men are called to redefine their life not anymore in terms of destiny but free will.

>Here lies one of the main differences between the two cultures: Christian theology divided time into past, present and future, and such a conception of time forced Western civilization to study nature in order to unveil the secret held by the mysterious future, and so they opened the sky and they dug up the earth to compete with nature and enrich themselves with a promise of Heaven. Asian civilization did not compete with nature for they never had a future to decode, the same divination is a practice used to adjust the present rather than the attempt to change coming events, Asians, China specifically, therefore did not challenge nature but rather accepted it.

>And because China did not have the idea of future neither of responsibility, because China, out of fear, did not try to fill the gap between man and nature first, nor man and divine after, capitalism was replaced by a subsistence economy, which felt to have reached stability with the introduction of collectivism, the repetitiveness of the economic and social system led to conservatism, conservatism brought despotism in the political shape of socialism.

>ancient Chinese thinkers viewed the world as a complete and complex organism where events happen the way they happen because of their position on the ever **moving cyclical universe**.

>China is always been concerned about **enduring** rather than developing and
duration is often synonymous with repetition, harmony is provided by an orthodoxy that can provides immobility: family system, kinship, rituals, the dynastic political apparatus, the extremely complex bureaucracy area, all attempts to **maintain** China as it is.

>broadly speaking Chinese philosophy, gave China stability, the idea of an equilibrium ruling men’s destiny, a dialectic of opposition without synthesis and yet guaranteeing the balance of the universe while contemplating a resemblance of change.

>Western philosophy therefore did not offer stability, it offered immortality. Western society did believe in the promise made by Christianity, believed in the after-life, a glorious stage of peace and prosperity to be reached either by divine election or personal achievements.


Maintenance (Ukeles Feminism performance manifesto) Perpetuating temporality, repeat daily life; 

>One could say that the core of maintenance is born from the life instinct, the perpetuation of life. Even more, it is the key of prolongation, it is the suspension of time, of some type of event, connection, relationship, development. Achtung! It is not development itself. It is something repetitive, to maintain a certain state or condition, a period of time where change is subtle or unnoticeable. It is like that unconscious habit of keeping a chewing gum in the mouth, and keep chewing that boring piece of plastic even if the flavor of it is over. Maintenance are also all those tasks one has to do, as an endless ritual stuck into the conception of everyday life. “Maintenance is a drag”. Maintenance is like a bug that one got used to. It nests quickly into unnoticed everyday things. It is everywhere. It is the unseen. Maintenance is a way of perpetuating a certain temporality, to keep things going.

Accumulation of time (a piece of awareness of the audience);

Buddhism spinning wheels;

Meditation - repeatedly work, scan body from top to bottom and back, and again and again.

Steve Reich, minimalist. Steve Reich defines process music not as, "the process of composition but rather pieces of music that are, literally, processes.

# Score:

Writing as a noise of Memories(plato)

Graphical score (Xenakis)

Score as a documentation of improvisation

# Sound:

Natural Harmony (i imagine, if the paper gets black (the all history, contribution of awareness of the audience) it will approach this sound)

Noise of Memories (inaccuracy)

# Vilem Flusser:

Open source interface, creativity, feedback in society

improvisation - incorporation

“the improvisation with continually reprogrammed memories will replace the score”

“I suspect that the emphasis on improvisation that we observe in Flussser and in the current practice of electroacoustic and digital music is an attempt to restore the so-called “authenticity of human experience” in the creative process. This effort of reconstructing subjectivity can be also observed in the current scholarship, for instance with the persistence of notions such as presence, materiality, and embodiment, together with the emphasis on the “experience of presence”.

# Heidegger (TECHNICS AND TIME)

The world is already here, before Dasein.

The historical dependence of man on the world in which he lives, there was a time before me, technology is not only the carrier of time, but more importantly, it is the original factor that constitutes time.

Any temporal form contains an "already-being formed independently of any perception".

The theme of **forgetting** dominates Heidegger's thinking of being. **Being is historial**, and the history of being is nothing but its inscription in technicity. If truth is itself thought in terms of this originary forgetting, it is insofar as the determination of the meaning of *alêtheia* still echoes the Platonic structure of reminiscence such as it is determined in opposition to hypomnesic memory, while this memory constitutes the destiny of being as the forgetting of being.

The possibility of refusing the horizon of authentic possibility takes root in "concern *(**Besorgen**),*a relation to the future which conceals in the future the opening of all authentic possibility. 

The technicalization of science consists in ignoring archetypes.

To give meaning to this technical act, and to give its correct result the meaning of truth...the original thought was put aside.

Technicization is what produces **loss of memory**, as was already the case in Plato's *Phœdrus.*
